# Data Science Tutorial

In this tutorial I walk a user through the entire data science pipeline, using a dataset about Brazilian fuel. I start with data curation, parsing, and management. Then, I perform exploratory data analysis, followed by machine learning to provide further analysis. Finally, I curate a conclusive message covering the insights I discovered during this tutorial.
